Cities are becoming increasingly crowded with vehicles, a trend fueled by population growth
and rising living standards. This surge in traffic has led to two major problems: rising air
pollution and a growing number of road accidents. Studies have shown that vehicle emissions
are a major culprit behind air pollution in urban areas, particularly in developing countries.
These emissions not only contribute to a decline in environmental health but also pose a
serious threat to human health, causing respiratory problems and even premature deaths.
Unfortunately, current air quality monitoring systems and traffic management solutions are
often fragmented and struggle to keep pace with the rapid growth of traffic. Similarly, the
number of road accidents, especially involving two-wheeler riders, is on the rise globally.
Traditional methods of traffic monitoring and enforcement are becoming increasingly
laborious and time-consuming as the number of vehicles continues to climb. This situation
demands a more efficient and intelligent approach to managing traffic and ensuring safety on
our roads.

To achieve an integrated system, CCTV video input is processed through a vehicle detection
model, generating frames for subsequent application of Emission Detection and Helmet
Detection models. Optical Character Recognition is then applied for Number Plate
Recognition. The selection deep learning models such as YOLOv8, YOLOv9 are chosen for
their effectiveness in various detection tasks.
For robust vehicle identification, the number plate identification encompasses detection,
where the number plate is localized, and recognition. The project employs advanced deep
learning techniques such as YOLOV9, Followed by Optical Character Recognition using
TrOCR.
